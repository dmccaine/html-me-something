  <p>In my lifetime, we've had over 30 pets coming in and out of our home.&nbsp;
     Many are fostered and found on the street, and many were from abused homes.</p>
  <p id="para2">Dogs are innocent creatures, only cruel when raised to act in such a way.&nbsp;
    Many dogs are beaten and abused, and many grow personality issues because of this.&nbsp;
    Out of human ignorance, we see these beaten dogs as bad creatures, not considering&nbsp;
    them the innocent wonders of nature that they are. We take for granted the cruel&nbsp;
    owner(s) that they had before they came into their lives.</p>
  <p class="para3">A life lesson for all, whether it be with animals, or humans, is to treat them with &nbsp;
    patience and recognize that they are creatures with issues and pasts that have led&nbsp;
    them to act in the way they do. Almost no creature on earth enjoys causing harm to&nbsp;
    other creatures, but every action that they have committed and have been victim to&nbsp;
    has led them to this point. Things that hurt, are hurting.</p>
